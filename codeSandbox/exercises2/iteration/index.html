      <h1>Iteration 2: Building a Sentence</h1>
      <h2>Iterating a Collection of Words to Build a Sentence</h2>
      <p>
        In this exercise, you're going to iterate a collection of strings and
        concatenate (i.e. join) then together to form one, continuous string as
        a sentence. Here's an example of how you can concatenate two string in
        JavaScript.
      </p>
      <pre><code>const family = ["Cathie", "John", "Mark", "Krista"];
let singleFamilyString = "I love my dog ";

for (let index = 0; index < family.length; index++) {
    singleFamilyString = `${singleFamilyString} and ${family[index]}`;
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        Just so you know, those characters are called backticks. It's a feature
        of JavaScript called string interpolation. That's a fancy word for a
        string builder. You can evaluate the value of a variable inside the
        backticks by wrapping the variable name in curly braces, and then
        placing a dollar sign at the beginning.
      </p>
      <pre><code>const myDogsName = "Angus";

const message = `I love my dog ${myDogsName} so much!`;</code></pre>
      <p>
        You are going to be iterating over two separate arrays filled with
        words. Each word should be added to a single variable that holds the
        sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        If that doesn't make sense, that's ok. There's another way to
        concatenate strings. You can use the plus sign.
      </p>
      <pre><code>const family = ["Cathie", "John", "Mark", "Krista"];
let singleFamilyString = "I love my dog ";

for (let index = 0; index < family.length; index++) {
    singleFamilyString = singleFamilyString + " and " + family[index];
}</code>
			</pre>

        Down below this you'll see two tabs: <b>Console</b> and <b>Problems</b>.
        We're going to only pay attention to the <b>Console</b> tab for now, so
        go ahead and open that up and let's start writing some JavaScript! ðŸ˜„

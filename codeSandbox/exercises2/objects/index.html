      <h1>Objects 2: Flower Shop</h1>
      <h2>Multiple Objects</h2>
      <p>
        Since software developers utilize objects to represent real-world things
        that need to be automated with software, it is critical to know that the
        properties of the "things" are. Consider an example where a fire chief
        needs to assign some firefighters to fire stations. What would need to
        be an object in this scenario.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>An object representing each firefighter</li>
        <li>An object representing each fire station</li>
        <li>An object representing the fire chief</li>
      </ol>
      <p>First, the fire chief</p>
      <pre><code>const fireChief = {
    firstName: "Samantha",
    lastName: "Robinson",
    yearsOfService: 13,
    emtCertification: true,
    paramediaCertification: true,
    firefighterCertification: true
}</code></pre>
      <p>Now some firefighters.</p>
      <pre><code>const matthew = {
    firstName: "Matthew",
    lastName: "Ingersoll",
    yearsOfService: 4,
    emtCertification: false,
    paramediaCertification: true,
    firefighterCertification: true
}

const jamal = {
    firstName: "Jamal",
    lastName: "Ross",
    yearsOfService: 5,
    emtCertification: true,
    paramediaCertification: false,
    firefighterCertification: true
}

const erin = {
    firstName: "Erin",
    lastName: "McNamara",
    yearsOfService: 3,
    emtCertification: false,
    paramediaCertification: true,
    firefighterCertification: true
}</code></pre>
      <p>Now, two objects for the fire stations.</p>
      <pre><code>const eastStation = {
    address: "1002 Main Street",
    squareFootage: 4720,
    kitchen: true,
    beds: true,
    showers: true
}

const northStation = {
    address: "9 Lighthouse Road",
    squareFootage: 3233,
    kitchen: false,
    beds: false,
    showers: true
}</code></pre>
      <h2>Different Properties</h2>
      <p>
        Some of the objects represent the people, and some objects represent
        buildings. Therefore, the properties vary. Each JavaScript object should
        have only the properties that describe the real-world object it is
        representing. The value of each property can be different, depending on
        the current state of the real-world object. Just because two objects
        represent the same kind of thing does not mean the property values will
        always match.
      </p>
      <h2>Exercise: Flower Shop</h2>
      <p>
        In this exercise, you are going to create two objects that represent
        flowers - a Tulip and a Rose. The objects will be largely the same, but
        since roses have thorns and tulips do not, there will be a difference
        between the properties on each one.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the starter code in the editor, create two objects where you see the
        comments.
      </p>
      <p>Both flower objects should have the following keys.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>color</b> which will be a <span class="string">string</span>,
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>stemLength</b> which will be a <span class="number">number</span>,
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>growingSeason</b> which will be a string like
          <span class="string">"Summer"</span> or
          <span class="string">"Spring"</span>,
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>thorny</b> will be be a boolean value of
          <span class="bool">true</span> or <span class="bool">false</span>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Try it out!</h2>
      <p>
        Down below this you'll see two tabs: <b>Console</b> and <b>Problems</b>.
        We're going to only pay attention to the <b>Console</b> tab for now, so
        go ahead and open that up and let's start writing some JavaScript! ðŸ˜„

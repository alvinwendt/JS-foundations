      <h1>Conditionals 2: Multiple Conditions</h1>
      <h2>Checking the Value of More Than One Variable</h2>
      <p>
        In a software application, there are many times where you may need to
        check more than one condition for one branch of your logic to run, or a
        different one. What do we mean by branch or logic? Here's a traditional
        image to visualize a logic branch.
      </p>

      <h2>Real-World Scenario</h2>
      <p>
        Let's discuss a situation in which two conditions must be met for a
        certain branch of your logic to run.
      </p>
      <p>
        You're back in your car, deciding where to eat. If your brother, Chad,
        is with you, and is the only passenger, he always says he's fine eating
        at a taco truck, but if Mom and Dad are also in the car, then he would
        rather eat sushi. The condition of when you are alone still stand.
      </p>
      <pre><code>const driving = true;
const chadIsWithMe = false;

if (driving && chadIsWithMe) {
    console.log("We're having tacos tonight");
} else {
    console.log("I'm having fast food tonight");
}</code
			></pre>
      <p>
        The first condition of checking if you are alone is still a single
        condition. If that evaluates to true then you're eating fast food. Now
        though, there are additional variables in play. You need to determine if
        Brad is with you, and also if your parents are with you because where
        you end up eating depends on those two variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you need to check if one condition is true and another condition is
        true, you can use two ampersand symbols next to each other. They are
        JavaScript code for a logical AND operation. Using && means that both
        conditions must be true in order for the code in that branch of logic to
        run.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another character that you see in the final condition check is the
        exclamation point (or "bang" in developer language) before the variable
        is used to determine if it is NOT true. In that final condition, the
        English translation is, "If Brad is with me, and my parents are not with
        me."
      </p>
      <h2>Try it out!</h2>
      <p>
        Down below this you'll see two tabs: <b>Console</b> and <b>Problems</b>.
        We're going to only pay attention to the <b>Console</b> tab for now, so
        go ahead and open that up and let's start writing some JavaScript!

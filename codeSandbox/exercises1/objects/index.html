      <h1>Objects 1: Introduction and Syntax</h1>
      <h2>Representing Life as Objects</h2>
      <p>
        Software developers are paid to represent real-world things and
        processes in code. To represent things like people, tools, animals,
        flowers, businesses, and financial transactions, we use objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can identify an object in JavaScript by a series of properties
        surround by curly braces { and } Here's a simple object that represents
        this chapter..
      </p>
      <pre><code>const objectsIntro = {
    site: "codesandbox.io",
    subject: "Objects",
    chapter: "Introduction and Syntax",
    audience: "Beginners",
    minutesToComplete: 4.25
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        A property on an object is comprised of a key and a value. You can think
        of them just like declaring a variable, but the syntax is slightly
        different, and the variable is now grouped together with other ones in
        the context of the object.
      </p>
      <pre><code>// Regular variable declarations
const firstName = "Michael"
const lastName = "McLenton"
const age = 25
const city = "Nashville"

// Same variables scoped to an object
const michael = {
    firstName: "Michael",
    lastName: "McLenton",
    age: 25,
    city: "Nashville"
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        You've replaced the = sign with a colon : for assigning a value to a
        variable. When a variable is defined this way - in the scope of an
        object - it's called a property. The variable name is now now called a
        key. The value is still called value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is an example of representing a book as an object in JavaScript.
      </p>
      <pre><code>const book = {
    title: "Where the Wild Things Are",
    isbn: "0-06-025492-0",
    publisher: "Harper & Row",
    publicationDate: "1963",
    pages: 40
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        You can put as many properties on an object as you need to appropriately
        describe that object, and what you need to display to people who are
        viewing the information.
      </p>
      <h2>Exercise: Your First Object</h2>
      <p>
        In the code editor, you will see some starter code. You only need to
        focus on the following code.
      </p>
      <pre><code>/* Create your student object here  */
const student = </code></pre>
      <p>
        After the <b>student =</b> your job is to create an object that
        represents a new student who is learning how to write software. The
        student should have the following properties..
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A name property with a value of "Jeremy Landy"</li>
        <li>A location property with a value of "Phoenix, AR"</li>
        <li>A gender property with value of "male"</li>
        <li>An age property with a value of 31</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So you need the curly braces, and the properties. Leave the rest of the
        code unchanged.
      </p>
      <h2>Try it out!</h2>
      <p>
        Down below this you'll see two tabs: <b>Console</b> and <b>Problems</b>.
        We're going to only pay attention to the <b>Console</b> tab for now, so
        go ahead and open that up and let's start writing some JavaScript! ðŸ˜„

      <h1>Functions Intro 1: Introduction and Syntax</h1>
      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>
        Functions are the heart and soul of JavaScript developers. Everything
        that a modern application does is done in a function. An application can
        have hundreds, possibly thousands, of tasks that it must perform to
        solve a problem or provide a service to humans. Each one of those tasks
        is in a function.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >You can think of a function as a container for code that completes a
          specific task.</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        These tasks are referenced with a variable, just like numbers, arrays
        and objects. Here is the basic syntax of what we call an arrow function.
        It's a very concise syntax for defining a task.
      </p>
      <pre><code>const descriptiveVariable = () => {
    // Code to perform the task goes here
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        Think of functions like minions that work for you. Each minion is
        designated a specific task that makes up your life.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Buy groceries</li>
        <li>Pay bills</li>
        <li>Prepare meals</li>
        <li>
          Do math stuff when you don't want to (<i
            >which, if we're being honest, is most of the time</i
          >)
        </li>
        <li>Take the car to the repair shop</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Buying Grocery Task</h2>
      <p>
        Functions sometimes need to be given information in order to complete
        the task. Let's look at how you would write task code for a minion that
        buys groceries.
      </p>
      <pre><code>const buyGroceries = () => {
    // Code to buy groceries with money
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        Since the minions can't read your mind, that means that you must provide
        it with the list of items you want it to purchase. Otherwise, the minion
        can't do its job.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a JavaScript function, you specify that input of information with
        what's called a <b>parameter</b>. Parameters go inside the parenthesis
        before the arrow. In the code below, the
        <b>arrayOfFoodToBuy</b> variable is the parameter for the function.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is important to note that parameters
        <b>only work inside the function.</b>
        The variable that you type inside those parenthesis cannot be used
        anywhere else in your code. You will be reminded of this fact throughout
        this series of exercises.
      </p>
      <pre><code>// Define the task for a minion
const buyGroceries = (arrayOfFoodToBuy) => {

    // Code to buy groceries with money
    for (const food of arrayOfFoodToBuy) {
        console.log(`I bought ${food}`)
    }
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        What you have now is a definition of a task. The minion hasn't been told
        to perform the task yet, though. You need to tell the minion which food
        to buy, and then direct the minion to start the task.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is called <i><b>invoking</b></i> a function. You type in the name
        of the task, and then put parenthesis after it. Inside the parenthesis,
        you provide the information that the minion needs. In this case, it
        needs an array of food items to buy. Software developers call the values
        inside those parenthesis <i><b>arguments</b></i
        >.
      </p>
      <pre><code>/*
    Vocabulary:
        - <b>buyGroceries</b> is a variable whose value is a function
        - <b>arrayOfFoodToBuy</b> is a parameter. It can only be used in the function.
*/
const buyGroceries = (arrayOfFoodToBuy) => {

    // Code to buy groceries with money
    for (const food of arrayOfFoodToBuy) {
        console.log(`I bought ${food}`)
    }
}

// Invoke the function. The array of strings is the argument.
buyGroceries( ["Milk", "Onions", "Ketchup"] )</code></pre>
      <h2>Practice: Filling the Tank</h2>
      <p>
        You have some starter code provided. It's a blank function that defines
        the task of filling your car up with gas. You can see that the minion
        will let you know that it filled up the car with gas, but
        <i><b>you</b></i> need to tell it how much gas you want put into the
        tank.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the minion needs information from you to do its job, you need to
        define the parameter of <b>gallons</b> inside the parenthesis of the
        function. When you do that successfully, run the code and the minion
        will let you know when it completes the task.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now change the <i><b>argument</b></i> value. It is currently 15. Change
        it to any other number and see how the behavior of the function changes
        when the argument does.
      </p>
      <h2>Try it out!</h2>
      <p>
        Down below this you'll see two tabs: <b>Console</b> and <b>Problems</b>.
        We're going to only pay attention to the <b>Console</b> tab for now, so
        go ahead and open that up and let's start writing some JavaScript! ðŸ˜„

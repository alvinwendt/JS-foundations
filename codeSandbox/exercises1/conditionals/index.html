            <h1>Conditionals 1: Single Conditions</h1>
            <h2>Conditions</h2>
            <p>
                Conditions are used by software developers when the value of a
                variable can be one of many possible ones, and the instructions
                to follow will be different given a certain value. Much like the
                decisions that you make on a daily basis, you decide to do
                something different when there are certain conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are hungry, and you are driving by yourself, you decide
                to eat quickly at a fast food restaurant.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if you have your family with you, you decide to eat at
                a casual dining restaurant.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a software developer, this kind of everyday logic would look
                like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
const numberOfPassengers = 4;

if (numberOfPassengers > 1) {
  // Condition evaluated true
  console.log("We will eat at Sushi Tomo tonight.");
} else {
  // Condition evaluated false
  console.log("I will eat at Burger King tonight.");
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Variables can also hold what's called a boolean value. A boolean
                value is either true or false. This is different than a string.
            </p>
            <p><span class="string">"true"</span> is a string value.</p>
            <p><span class="bool">true</span> is a boolean value.</p>
            <pre><code>
const learningCodeIsHard = true;

if (learningCodeIsHard === true) {
    console.log("Research and ask for help");
} else {
    console.log("You need to find harder problems to solve.");
}
            </code></pre>
            <h2>Try it out!</h2>
            <p>
                Down below this you'll see two tabs: <b>Console</b> and
                <b>Problems</b>. We're going to only pay attention to the
                <b>Console</b> tab for now, so go ahead and open that up and
                let's start writing some JavaScript! ðŸ˜„

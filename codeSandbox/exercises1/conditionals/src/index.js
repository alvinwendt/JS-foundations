// 1. Instantiate (create) and assign your name to a variable called "name", then console.log() it!

// 3. Instantiate and assign whether or not you like dogs to a variable called "likesDogs" (true/ false), then console.log() it!

/*
  ***** THE CONDITIONALS: *****
  You start with a variable that contains a boolean value (true or false).
  In modern JavaScript, you can use one of two keywords: `let` or `const`

  `let` is used for defining a variable whose value can change
  `const` is used for defining a variable whose value cannot change
*/
const pastaIsMyFavoriteFood = true;

/*
  Write an `if` condition that checks to see if the
  value of `pastaIsMyFavoriteFood` is true or false.
  If the condition evaluates to true, then use the
  `console.log()` function to display the message:
  "I will have the lasagna, please"

  If the condition evaluates to false, use the
  `console.log()` function to display the message:
  "I will have the daily special"

  Example: console.log("I will have the lasagna, please");

/*
    ***** PART 2: *****
      - Define a new variable using const called "favoriteAnimal"
      - Store your favorite animal as a string in the "favoriteAnimal" variable
*/
// Define a const variable here 👇

/*
  - Write an `if` condition that checks to see if the value of "favoriteAnimal" is a string of "penguin". If it is a penguin, then use the `console.log()` function to display the message: "Waddle, waddle!"

  - If the "favoriteAnimal" variable is NOT "penguin", then use the `console.log()` function to display the message: "My favorite animal is NOT the penguin!"

  - Change the value of "favoriteAnimal" to see your console log different things! 🕵️‍♀️

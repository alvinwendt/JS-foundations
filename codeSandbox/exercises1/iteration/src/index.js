// 1. movieArray is an array that should hold a list of your favorite movies!
const movieArray = [];

// 2. Add the movie "The Bee Movie" into the array. (HINT: .push() it into the array!)

// 3. Log the newly added movie to the console. At which index is the new movie? (HINT: You'll need these ðŸ‘‰ [])

// 5. Write a `for loop` to loop over the movieArray and console.log each movie!
for (let i = 0; i < movieArray.length; i++) {
  // ???
}

/*
  ***** CHALLENGE *****
  Inside of the `for loop` for the movieArray, write a conditional that checks to see:
      - IF the movie is "The Bee Movie", log to the console: "According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly."
      - ELSE, then log the movie to the console.

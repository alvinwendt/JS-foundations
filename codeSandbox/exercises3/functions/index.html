      <h1>Functions Intro 3: Return to Sender</h1>
      <h2>Preface: Naming Things is Hard</h2>
      <p>
        Software developers often define many variables while they are passing
        data around in their code. Sometimes it can be daunting to come up with
        good variable names to store those values. Even in this introductory
        exercise, you will need to declare and use variables 5 or 6 times.
      </p>
      <p>It gets confusing.</p>
      <p>
        The best advice is to name a variable that corresponds to it value. For
        example, if you have a number that needs to be passed to a function as
        an argument. What does that number represent?
      </p>
      <p>
        If it's the age of a person, a great name for the variable would be
        <b>age</b> or <b>personAge</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it's just a number that has no other context, it's perfectly fine to
        name the variable <b>number</b>, <b>firstNumber</b>, or
        <b>originalNumber</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <u><b>Reminder:</b></u>
        <i
          >JavaScript doesn't care at all what your variable names are. In fact,
          it ignores them completely. All JavaScript cares about is the value of
          the variable. Variables are for the other humans reading your code.</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following code, you may be tempted to say that you are "logging
        color to the console". You are not. You are logging the string of "red"
        to the console.
      </p>
      <pre><code>const color = "red"

console.log(color)</code></pre>
      <h2>Functions that Give Back</h2>
      <p>
        In the introduction, you invoked a function that had a single parameter
        so that you could fill up a car's gas tank with any specified number of
        gallons. The function itself defined a very basic task that just wrote a
        message to the console. This is usually not the case.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the time, functions actually give you something back after the
        task is complete. This is because software developers use functions to
        define transformation or calculation tasks. That sounds fancy, but it's
        not.
      </p>
      <p>Here's a simple example.</p>
      <h2>Half the Number</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes your brain just forgets all the math that it learned in high
        school and college. Finding what half of a number is sometimes beyond
        your capabilities, especially if you haven't had coffee yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        You decide to write a function that performs the task for you. A little
        Math Minion.
      </p>
      <p>
        You tell the minion what number needs to be provided. That's a
        parameter.
      </p>
      <pre><code>const findHalf = (scaryNumber) => {
    // Use the slash character to divide in JavaScript
    const half = scaryNumber / 2
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        So far, the minion did its job, but it never told you what the end
        result is!!
      </p>
      <p>Bad minion.</p>
      <p>
        You need to provide instructions to the minion to tell you what the
        answer is. You use the <b>return</b> keyword for that.
      </p>
      <pre><code>const findHalf = (scaryNumber) => {
    // Use the slash character to divide in JavaScript
    const half = scaryNumber / 2

    // Tell me the end result
    return half
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        Now when the task is complete, the minion will hand you the end result
        of its hard work. It <b>returns</b> something to you. When a function
        returns a value, you must store that value in a variable. Remember that
        variables store values, including ones that functions return.
      </p>
      <pre><code>const returnedNumber = findHalf(42)

console.log(returnedNumber)

> 21</code></pre>
      <h2>Write this Down. Read it Often.</h2>
      <p>
        There's a mantra that you need to remember when working with functions.
        It will save you heartache in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >If a function returns a value, you must store that value in a
          variable</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        You will practice this mechanism many times because this flow of data
        and syntax is not natural to understand or remember. It is, however,
        crucial to build into your muscle memory until it does make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >If a function returns a value, you must store that value in a
          variable</b
        >
      </p>
      <h2>Practice: Cut into Pieces</h2>
      <p>
        You have some starter code for a function named
        <b><i>quarterValue()</i></b
        >. It will work very similarly to the <b><i>findHalf()</i></b> function
        shown above. What you need to do is complete the following tasks:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In the function, define a parameter that will hold the value of the
          original number.
        </li>
        <li>In the function, divide that number by 4.</li>
        <li>In the function, return the quartered number.</li>
        <li>
          On the line of code where the function is invoked, store the returned
          number in a variable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Plug that variable into the parenthesis for the
          <b><i>console.log()</i></b>
        </li>
        <li>
          When you run the code, you should see the answer in the console.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Try it out!</h2>
      <p>
        Down below this you'll see two tabs: <b>Console</b> and <b>Problems</b>.
        We're going to only pay attention to the <b>Console</b> tab for now, so
        go ahead and open that up and let's start writing some JavaScript! ðŸ˜„

      <h1>Iteration 3: Using the Power of of</h1>
      <h2>Using the Power of of?</h2>
      <p>
        That's not a correct sentence... or is it??
      </p>
      <p>
        There's yet another type of for loop that iterates a series of
        instructions for each item in an iterable collection, like an array.
        From one of your previous exercises, here's an example of how to
        implement the exact same logic, but in significantly fewer characters.
        Software developers love being able to do the same logic, but in less
        characters.
      </p>
      <p>It's the <b>for..of</b> loop.</p>
      <pre><code>let sentence = "";
const loveRelationship = ["I", "love", "sitting", "on", "the", "beach"];

for (word of loveRelationship) {
    sentence = `${sentence} ${word}`;
}</code>
			</pre>
      <p>
        I don't know about you, but that code looks:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Easier to read
        </li>
        <li>
          Easier to understand
        </li>
        <li>
          Easier to write
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Time for you to give it a try. This time, you have to deal with object
        keys.
      </p>
      <h2>Try it out!</h2>

        Down below this you'll see two tabs: <b>Console</b> and <b>Problems</b>.
        We're going to only pay attention to the <b>Console</b> tab for now, so
        go ahead and open that up and let's start writing some JavaScript! ðŸ˜„

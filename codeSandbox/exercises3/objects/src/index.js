  PART 2: 99Â¢ Candy Store
  There's a wonderful new Candy Store down the road and EVERYTHING in the store is .99 cents each! Let's create a list of some of the candies that this store has available.
  1. Store an array in a variable called "candy"
  2. In the candy array, create 3-5 objects with properties that represent a candy:
    - a name property that holds a string
    - a type property that holds a string (like "gum", "chocolate", "lollipop", etc.)
  3. BUT WAIT! This is the 99Â¢ Candy Store, so we'll need to write a for..of loop that adds the "price" property to each candy object (The value should be .99)
*/

// 4. After adding the price property to each candy object, inside of the SAME for..of loop: Print each candy to the console. Ex: "The Dubble Bubble Gum is 99 cents!"

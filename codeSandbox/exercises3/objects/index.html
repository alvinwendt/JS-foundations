      <h1>Objects 3: Doctor Office Schedule</h1>
      <h2>Object Collections</h2>
      <p>
        In previous work in the prework sessions, you learned how to store a
        collection of related data in an array and how to use iteration to do
        something with everything in the array.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example, an array of your teammates's names can be joined together using
        a for..of loop, which iterates the array.
      </p>
      <pre><code>// Array of strings
const names = ["Jameka", "Rose", "Martin", "Greg", "Mary"]

// Blank string
let team = ""

// Iterate teammate name array
for (const name of names) {

    // Append to the team variable's value
    team += `Teammate: ${name}\n`
}

console.log(team)

/* OUTPUT:
    Teammate: Jameka
    Teammate: Rose
    Teammate: Martin
    Teammate: Greg
    Teammate: Mary
*/</code></pre>
      <p>In this exercise, you will be working with an array of objects.</p>
      <p>
        Using the same kind of logic that was in the example above, you can
        replace the string values in the array with objects that represent each
        teammate. It's still a collection of your teammates, but instead of
        simple string representations of each person, you now have object
        representations.
      </p>
      <pre><code>// Array of objects
const teammateArray = [
    {
        firstName: "Jameka",
        lastName: "Williams"
    },
    {
        firstName: "Rose",
        lastName: "McCallister",
    },
    {
        firstName: "Martin",
        lastName: "Orodruin"
    },
    {
        firstName: "Greg",
        lastName: "Killgrew"
    },
    {
        firstName: "Mary",
        lastName: "Thomas"
    }
]

// Blank string
let team = ""

// Iterate teammate name array
for (const teammateObject of teammateArray) {

    // Append to the team variable's value.
    // Use dot notation to access properties on objects.
    team += `Teammate: ${teammateObject.firstName} ${teammateObject.lastName}\n`
}

console.log(team)

/* OUTPUT:
    Teammate: Jameka Williams
    Teammate: Rose McCallister
    Teammate: Martin Orodruin
    Teammate: Greg Killgrew
    Teammate: Mary Thomas
*/</code></pre>
      <p><b>Line Breaks in Strings</b></p>
      <p>
        In the code above, if you look at the end of the string template, you
        will notice two characters: a backslash and the letter n.
      </p>
      <pre><code>team += `Teammate: ${teammateObject.firstName} ${teammateObject.lastName}\n`</code></pre>
      <p>
        Those two characters create a new line in the string. This allows you to
        have the output shown above, where each teammate is on a new line
        instead of one, continuous string.
      </p>
      <h2>Exercise: Doctor's Office Schedule</h2>
      <p>
        The office manager of a doctor's office wants to provide a list each day
        that shows the name of each patient, and the time of their appointment.
        An array of objects is provided with some same patients represented an
        objects. Write a for..of loop that iterates the objects in the array,
        and then use dot notation to append the patient's full name, and the
        time of their appointment to the string value of the schedule variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >Example output (yours will look different because the data is
          different)</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><i>Patient Nancy Johnson has an appointment at 9:30</i></p>
      <p><i>Patient Clarrissa Ford has an appointment at 10:15</i></p>
      <p><i>Patient Abigail Debrowski has an appointment at 11:00</i></p>
      <p><i>Patient John Beury has an appointment at 1:20</i></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >Note: Make sure you use \n at the end of your string templates to
          make each appointment on its own line</b
        >
      </p>
      <h2>Try it out!</h2>
      <p>
        Down below this you'll see two tabs: <b>Console</b> and <b>Problems</b>.
        We're going to only pay attention to the <b>Console</b> tab for now, so
        go ahead and open that up and let's start writing some JavaScript! ðŸ˜„

      <h1>Conditionals 3: Switch Statements</h1>
      <h2>Many Possible Values</h2>
      <p>
        So far you've worked with boolean values. A variable has a value of true
        or false. Many times, though, a variable can have many possible values.
        Consider that you want to do a different task depending on what day of
        the week it is. You would create a variable named
        <b>dayOfTheWeek</b> that will contain one of seven possible values.
        Depending on which day, you want to be reminded which daily task you
        want to perform
      </p>
      <p>
        A <b>switch</b> statement in JavaScript is perfect for this. Otherwise
        you would need to create seven different <b>if/then</b> statements.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
const dayOfTheWeek = "Tuesday";

// The switch statement is followed by the variable that should be
// evaluated. Then, the case statement that corresponds to the variable's
// value will be executed.

switch (dayOfTheWeek) {
    case "Monday":
        console.log("Vacuum the downstairs");
        break;

    case "Tuesday":
        console.log("Take out the trash");
        break;

    case "Wednesday":
        console.log("Go to pottery class");
        break;

    case "Thursday":
        console.log("Take the kids to swimming practice");
        break;

    case "Friday":
        console.log("Order pizza for family night");
        break;

    case "Saturday":
        console.log("Buy groceries");
        break;

    case "Sunday":
        console.log("Do the crossword puzzle");
        break;
}</code></pre>

    <h2>Try it out!</h2>
    <p>
      Down below this you'll see two tabs: <b>Console</b> and <b>Problems</b>.
      We're going to only pay attention to the <b>Console</b> tab for now, so go
      ahead and open that up and let's start writing some JavaScript!

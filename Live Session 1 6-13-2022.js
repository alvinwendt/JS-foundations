  ‚Ä£ The Left Panel:
    Click the cube icon (top left) to hide/show the left panel.

  ‚Ä£ The Console:
    You'll see the output (result) of your code in the console (bottom right)

  ‚Ä£ The Errors:
    If your code produces an error, a red error message will show up in the console.

  ***** THE CONDITIONALS: *****
  You start with a variable that contains a boolean value (true or false).
  In modern JavaScript, you can use one of two keywords: `let` or `const`

  `let` is used for defining a variable whose value can change
  `const` is used for defining a variable whose value cannot change
*/

  Write an `if` condition that checks to see if the
  value of `pastaIsMyFavoriteFood` is true or false.
  If the condition evaluates to true, then use the
  `console.log()` function to display the message:
  "I will have the lasagna, please"
  If the condition evaluates to false, use the
  `console.log()` function to display the message:
  "I will have the daily special"

  Example: console.log("I will have the lasagna, please");

Iteration

/*
  Use a `for` loop to iterate this array and display each value in the console below with `console.log()`.
  Remember to to start a counter variable at 0 and write a condition that makes your logic return
  just the right number of times.
*/
const words = ["Iguana", "Raven", "Ostrich", "Chicken", "Kite"];

 */

movieArray.push("The Bee Movie");
// 3. Log the newly added movie to the console. At which index is the new movie? (HINT: You'll need these üëâ [])
console.log(movieArray[4])

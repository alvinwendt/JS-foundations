# Nashville Software School Prework Sessions

## Why do we have them?

Incoming students are given prework to get started on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We run the prework sessions so students can ask questions, have someone walk through code with them, and talk to a REAL human being about their prework.

These sessions are optional to incoming students and they're free to come and go as they please. We're serving as a resource for them as they are working through the prework, if they choose to take advantage of this resource.

## What does a prework session look like? How do I run a prework session?

> Prework sessions are Thursday nights from 5pm-7pm _online_ via the Zoom app.

Now that the sessions are all online, **we record each prework session** so that way each and every one of the incoming students can get the most out of these sessions as possible. The recordings will be deleted after each cohort's start date.

Each session will typically have 1-2 NSS alumni/current students running the show. Start the session by introducing yourselves, what cohort you were/are in, and what you do now, etc. Then start with the first exercise in the codesandbox link and work your way through the rest. After each section of exercises is a link in the browser portion of codesandbox to the next set of exercises. It's okay if you haven't been working in JavaScript recently and you feel rusty! Let them know! What the students want to see is your thought process behind finding a solution to the problem.

The sessions are meant to be casual, so if you get through all of the exercises and you still have time left feel free to have them ask questions about being a student at NSS, life after NSS, anything they want to go over again, etc.

Each week we cover a different set of exercises that cover conditionals, iteration, objects, and functions. The exercises are on an online text editor called codesandbox and each section below has the link to its corresponding codesandbox exercises for the week. There is no work required on your part to come up with content! You will simply be live coding the javascript exercises and answer student questions as they come up. You don't have to have an account with codesandbox, once you start coding, a forked repo will automatically be made.
 > The incoming students are exactly that: incoming students. They haven't had the NSS experience yet and they might be quiet and shy, so don't worry if it seems like they're not listening or participating as much as you'd want. They're appreciative of the time that they're getting with you! ðŸ˜Š

### Important Notes

1. Do not use your actual text editor to work in (codesandbox isn't the best, but the students won't have to worry about installing anything too early).
1. Things that incoming students have seen/used in the prework:
    * The use of `let` and `const`
    * String interpolation
    * Arrow function syntax
